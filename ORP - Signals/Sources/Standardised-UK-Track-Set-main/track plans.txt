Individual parameters to define the speed limit for each track type.
Parameter to turn off speed limits
Parameter for build costs/infrastructure costs

Parameter for depots & fences:

None (no fences)
Default (defined by other grfs)
Dynamic (changes over time)
Extensive (every track type has a different style of depot/fence)


Buffer stop objects for each track type
